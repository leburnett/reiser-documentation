title: "Reiser Lab Documentation"
---

This documentation covers how to **design**, **run**, and **analyse** experiments using LED panel arena setups for experiments with *Drosophila melanogaster* within the Reiser Lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus.

## How to use this documentation

Each experiment section follows a consistent structure designed to serve different needs:

| Tier | What it contains | Who it's for |
|:-----|:-----------------|:-------------|
| **Overview** | Project summary, experiment workflow, and links to all pages in the section | Anyone getting oriented with a project |
| **Quickstart** | Prerequisites checklist and quick-reference steps for running, making, and analysing protocols | Experienced users who need a quick refresher, or new users who want to get started fast |
| **Rig Specs** | Arena hardware, software requirements, and calibration constants | Anyone setting up or troubleshooting the physical rig |
| **Deep Dives** | Detailed protocol descriptions, stimulus generation, analysis pipelines, and data structures | Users who need to understand *how* and *why* things work |
| **Reference** | Code architecture, data formats, experiment logs, and visualisation tools | Users looking up specific technical details |
| **Help** | Troubleshooting guides organised by experiment stage, common errors, and quality control checks | Anyone who has hit a problem |

### Where to start
**New to a project?** Start with the **Quickstart** page for that section — it has a prerequisites checklist and the essential steps to run and analyse an experiment. Then check the **Rig Specs** page for hardware and software details.

**Something not working?** Jump straight to the **Troubleshooting** page at the bottom of each section's sidebar.

## Experiment sections

### [Freely-walking experiments](Freely-walking/index.qmd)

Behavioural experiments measuring optomotor responses, motion-induced centring, and locomotion in freely-walking *Drosophila* using the **G3 LED arena**. Part of the Freely Walking Course Control Mechanisms screen (2025).

&rarr; [Quickstart](Freely-walking/freely_walking_quickstart.qmd)

### [Electrophysiology experiments](Ephys/index.qmd)

Patch electrophysiology experiments characterising receptive field structure and direction selectivity of visual neurons using the **G4 LED arena**. Includes the Nested RF Protocol and DS Probe Protocol (2024–2025).

&rarr; [Nested RF Quickstart](Ephys/ephys_nested_rf.qmd)

### [Tethered flight experiments](Tethered/index.qmd)

Two-alternative forced choice experiments with tethered flying *Drosophila* using the **G4 LED arena**. *(Documentation in progress.)*
