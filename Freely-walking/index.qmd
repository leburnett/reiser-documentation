This documentation outlines the creation, execution, and analysis of behavioural experiments using the G3 LED arena setup in the Reiser Lab at HHMI’s Janelia Research Campus performed as part of the <b>Freely walking course control mechanisms</b> screen conducted in <b>2025</b>. 

______________________

The experiment protocol was designed by Laura Burnett and experiments were conducted by Laura Burnett and <b>Aparna Dev</b> from PTR. All fly husbandry was carried out by <b>Edward Rogers</b>.

This documentation includes information on how to [design and run](Freely-walking/freely_walking_how_to_run_exp.qmd) protocols, [analyse]() the data, as well as the [specifications](Freely-walking/freely-walking-rig-specs.qmd) of the arena.

______________________

For clarity, this documentation will centre on how to run and analyse the specific [protocol](Freely-walking/protocols/freely_walking_protocol_27.qmd) that was used in the screen experiments (`protocol_27.mat`). 

Other protocols that were run on this arena can be found within the `protocols` [folder](https://github.com/leburnett/freely-walking-optomotor/tree/main/protocols) of the repository, but they are not documented here.
