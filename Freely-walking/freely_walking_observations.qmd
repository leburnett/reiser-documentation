title: "Recording observations"
---

The script `data_review/review_behavioural_data.m` provides a GUI for manually scoring behavioural responses from the per-condition videos generated by `generate_circ_stim_ufmf`.

### Workflow

1. Generate per-condition videos using `generate_circ_stim_ufmf` (see [Visualisation](freely_walking_visualisation.qmd)).
2. Navigate to the folder containing the condition videos.
3. Run `review_behavioural_data.m` from within that folder.
4. The script opens each video in turn and presents a GUI with dropdown scoring fields and a free-text observation box.
5. Scores and observations are submitted to a Google Form, which stores the results in a linked Google Sheet.

The script can be filtered to show only specific stimulus types (e.g. `"gratings"`, `"flicker"`, `"phototaxis"`, `"reversephi"`, `"static"`, `"offset"`) rather than all videos.

### Observation fields

Each condition is scored on the following dimensions using a dropdown (0–10 scale):

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Centring | Degree to which flies aggregate near the arena centre (0 = no centring, 10 = tightly clustered at centre) |
| Turning | Strength of directional turning response to the stimulus |
| Rebound | Presence and strength of rebound behaviour after stimulus offset |
| Distribution | Spatial distribution of flies during the stimulus |
| Locomotion | General locomotion level during the stimulus |
| Diversity | Variability of behaviour across individual flies |

A free-text field is also available for recording any additional observations as a string.

### Metadata

The script automatically extracts metadata from the video filename (date, time, condition number, condition name, repetition) and includes it in the Google Form submission alongside the scores.

See the [logging system](freely_walking_logging_system.qmd) page for how to set up a Google Form for automatic data logging.
