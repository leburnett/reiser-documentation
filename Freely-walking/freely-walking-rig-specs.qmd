These protocols are designed to run on the Reiser Lab's G3 18 x 3 LED panel setup.

- 18 panel circumeference.
- 3 panel height.
- Each panel is 8 x 8 pixels, so the arena is 18 x 8 = 144 pixels wide and 3 x 8 = 24 pixels high.
- Each pixel is 1.875 degrees of visual angle per pixel and covers 360 degrees of visual angle along the azimuth and 45 degrees of visual angle along the elevation.
- The LEDS are green LEDs with a peak wavelength of ~570 nm.

There is a lot of useful, and more detailed documentation on the specifications of the G3 arena and how to design and run protocols [here](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/Generation%203/Software/docs/g3_user-guide.html).
