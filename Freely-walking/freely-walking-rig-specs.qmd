These protocols are designed to run on the Reiser Lab's G3 24 x 3 LED panel setup.

### LED arena

The arena consists of 24 panels arranged in a full cylinder (360° azimuth), 3 panels high. Each panel is 8 x 8 pixels, giving a total resolution of 192 pixels wide by 24 pixels high. The LEDs are green with a peak wavelength of ~570 nm.

| Parameter | Value | Units |
|:----------|:------|:------|
| Panel layout | 24 x 3 | panels |
| Resolution | 192 x 24 | pixels |
| Visual angle per pixel | 1.875 | degrees |
| Azimuth coverage | 360 | degrees |
| Elevation coverage | 45 | degrees |
| LED wavelength | ~570 | nm (green) |
| Greyscale levels | 1-bit (2), 2-bit (4), 3-bit (8), or 4-bit (16) | — |

### Arena geometry

The following constants are used throughout the processing code for converting between pixel coordinates and physical distances:

| Parameter | Value | Units |
|:----------|:------|:------|
| Arena radius | 119.0 (496 px) | mm |
| Arena center | [126.6, 124.7] ([528, 520] px) | mm |
| Pixels per mm (PPM) | 4.1691 | px/mm |
| Camera frame rate | 30 | fps |
