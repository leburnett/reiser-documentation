`folder_review/review_behavioural_data.m` - script to run within the folder containing the condition videos generated using the `generate_circ_stim_ufmf` function. This script runs through the videos within the folder. It opens each one in turn, opens a pop up with simple drop down fields and also allows for observations to be inputted as a string. This data is all fed into a google form which stores the results. These observations can then be viewed within the google sheet that is linked to the form.

Fields in the dropdown box:
    - Centring (add options)
    - Turning 
    - Rebound
    - Distribution 
    - Locomotion
    - Diversity
