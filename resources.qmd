#### Other resources

The <b>LED Display Tools</b> [documentation](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/) contains detailed information on the different versions of the LED arenas, the different GUIs that can be used to generate patterns and run protocols and the MATLAB functions that can be used to interact with the LED arenas.

- This [page](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/Generation%203/Software/docs/g3_user-guide.html) has useful historical information about running experiments on the G3 and G4 arenas, especially tethered flight experiments. It explains how the MATLAB `panel_com` class of functions can be used to interact with and display patterns on the LED arenas. 

- This [page](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/G4/) has more detailed information on the G4 setups and the different GUIs that can be used to generate patterns and run protocols on the G4 arena.
