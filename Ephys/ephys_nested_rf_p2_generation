How the second part of the nested RF protocol, P2, is generated. 


Describe how "create_protocol2" and "run_protocol2" work.


`create_protocol2` basically makes the ".g4p" content which is required to run the protocol on the G4 arena. 

"pattern_order", "func_order" and "trial_dur". 



The fact that you need to create an array of the patterns and position functions to be run together. 
Make the two static functions.
