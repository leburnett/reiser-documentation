![<b>Experiment Rig: </b> G4 LED - Ephys arena with a cartoon representation of the position of the fly within the arena. For many protocols, visual stimuli are only presented over 1/2 of the arena screen, ipsilateral to the location of the recorded cell.](../assets/imgs/ephys/nested_RF_stimulus/setup.png){.ifr_center}

::: {.callout-important}
Leftmost panel is not used, so there are 11 panels in total. When making patterns, the image will start being presented from pixel 17. Pixels 1-16 represent the missing panel.

::: {.callout-note}
The arena can be tilted in elevation depending on how the fly is positioned in the rig. Make sure to keep a note of the angle of the arena.
