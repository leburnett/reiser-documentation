title: "Ephys Overview"

This documentation outlines the creation, execution, and analysis of electrophysiology experiments using the G4 LED arena setup in the Reiser Lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus performed by <b>Jin Yong Park</b> of PTR in 2024 and 2025.

In 2024, the [`DS_probe_protocol`](/Ephys/ephys_nested_rf.qmd) was created to investigate directionally selective responses in some less well characterized cell types that had been predicted to have directionally selective responses based on the spatial positioning of input synapses along their dendrites. This analysis was spearheaded by <b>Judith Hoeller</b> of the Romani lab at Janelia. 

In late 2024-2025, the [`nested_RF_stimulus`](/Ephys/ephys_ds_probe_protocol.qmd) protocol was created to more thoroughly investigate the receptive field properties of T4/T5 cells in Drosophila as well as their directionally selective responses to moving bars. It was generated for experiments that were part of a collaboration with the Zipursky lab at UCLA that aimed to investigate the role of the receptor-associated protein turtle "Tutl" on the establishment of directionally selective responses in T4/T5 cells. This protocol was based on a protocol created previously by <b>Eyal Gruntman</b> in the Reiser lab.
