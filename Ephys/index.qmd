title: "Electrophysiology Experiments"
---

This documentation covers patch electrophysiology experiments using the G4 LED arena in the Reiser Lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus. Experiments were performed by **Jin Yong Park** of PTR in 2024 and 2025.

### New to these experiments?
Start with the [Rig Specs](ephys_rig_specs.qmd) page for hardware and software requirements. Then jump to the **Quickstart** for the protocol you need — each has a prerequisites checklist, experiment workflow, and links to all deep-dive guides.

## Protocols

### [Nested RF Protocol](ephys_nested_rf.qmd)

Created in late 2024–2025 to characterise the receptive field structure and direction selectivity of T4/T5 visual neurons in *Drosophila*[^2]. Part of a collaboration with the Zipursky lab at UCLA. Based on an earlier protocol by **Eyal Gruntman** in the Reiser lab[^1].

This is a two-part protocol:

- **Protocol 1** — coarse receptive field mapping using flashing squares on a grid
- **Protocol 2** — high-resolution RF mapping and direction selectivity using moving bars and small flashes, targeted to the RF location found in P1

See the [Nested RF Quickstart](ephys_nested_rf.qmd) for a prerequisites checklist, experiment workflow, and links to all deep-dive pages.

### [DS Probe Protocol](ephys_ds_probe_protocol.qmd)

Created in 2024 to investigate directionally selective responses in less well characterised cell types predicted to have direction selectivity based on dendritic synapse positioning. This analysis was spearheaded by **Judith Hoeller** of the Romani lab at Janelia.

## Shared resources

- [Rig Specs](ephys_rig_specs.qmd) — G4 arena hardware, panel configuration, and calibration
- [G4 Software & GUIs](/resources.qmd#g4-software) — pattern generator, experiment designer, and experiment conductor tools

## Code availability

- Nested RF Protocol: [nested_RF_stimulus](https://github.com/leburnett/nested_RF_stimulus) repository. This code was cloned locally onto the computer for the G4 electrophysiology rig here: `C:\matlabroot\G4_Protocols\nested_RF_stimulus\`.
- DS Probe Protocol: [DS_probe_protocol](https://github.com/leburnett/DS_probe_protocol) repository.

Running these experiments requires the user to have the [G4_Display_Tools](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/G4_Display_Tools) repository downloaded locally too.

## Data availability

The data from the Nested RF experiments can be found on the Reiser Lab prfs drive here: `smb://prfs.hhmi.org/reiserlab/burnettl/Ephys_experiments/nested_RF_stimulus/DATA`. The data is then further organised based on sub-type of experiment grouped in the same way as the [Experiment Log](/Ephys/ephys_nested_rf_exp_log.qmd).

The raw data is also found on the computer in the Ephys rig room within the folder `C:\matlabroot\G4_Protocols\nested_RF_protocol2\data`.

Please see the following [page](ephys_nested_rf_data_structure.qmd) for details on how the data is saved and stored.

::: {.callout-note}
The data within the folder `1DRF` contains <b>duplicates</b> of data in other folders. The curated folder contains a subset of experiments that were performed with the same experimental protocol. This data was selected to be used to make the main paper figure for the UCLA collaboration.
