The <b>Nested RF Protocol</b> was designed by LE Burnett in 2024 for patch electrophysiology experiments ran by JY Park. 
It is a multi-step protocol that tries to probe the receptive field (RF) structure of the neuron being recorded. 

It was based upon the protocol used in <i>Gruntman et al. 2019(^ref)</i>. 

The code for generating and running these protocols is publicly available [here](https://github.com/leburnett/nested_RF_stimulus).
Running these experiments requires the user to have the 'G4_Display_Tools' [repository](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/G4_Display_Tools) downloaded locally too.
