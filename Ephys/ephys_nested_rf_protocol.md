The 'Nested RF Protocol' was designed by LE Burnett in 2024 for patch electrophysiology experiments ran by JY Park. It is a multi-step protocol that tries to probe the receptive field (RF) structure of the neuron being recorded. 


# Protocol 1 
- Large black and white squares presented in a non-overlapping grid pattern across one half of the screen (how many panels?). Two sizes. 
- After processing returns figures of the response to each square (averaged across 4 reps). Can identify whether the cell preferentially responds to black or white squares, and the location of the flash that elicited the largest response.

## Postiion function


# Protocol 2
- describe what patterns are shown in this protocol. Moving bars and flashes.
- Smallers black OR white squares - overlapping grid pattern. 
- Need to enter the location of the flash position that elicited the largest resopnse from the first protocol.
- This script then generates the patterns centred on that position to then be shown in protocol 2.
