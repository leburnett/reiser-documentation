title: "Protocol 2"

::: {.callout-note}
### Quick summary:
More in-depth and feature-focused protocol. This protocol typically takes between 20-25 minutes.

- **Aim 1:** Determine higher resolution features of the cell's receptive field by using smaller flashes.
- **Aim 2:** Determine whether the cell displays directionally selective responses to bar sweeps in 16 directions.

- **Overview:**
- Longer, high resolution probing of the cell's receptive field.
- Custom script design.
- Opens a pop-up at the beginning that asks the user to fill in the `peak_frame` from P1 and the side of the arena used for P1.
- This `peak_frame` value is then used to generate a protocol with the stimuli centred on the centre of the flash that elicited the greatest response in P1.
- These stimuli are presented within a 30 x 30 pixel area. The rest of the arena is set to the background intensity value.
- Only presents either dark or light stimuli. However, at the end of the protocol the `peak_frame` value that generates the protocol at the same location with the inverse contrast is returned so that the protocol can be run twice, once for each contrast if desired.

- **Location:** P2 is made de novo every time the function `generate_protocol2()` is run. A new folder of the format 'yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm' is made within the the folder `C:\matlabroot\G4_Protocols\nested_RF_protocol2` that contains both the patterns, functions and experiment file `currentExp.mat` and the data that was recorded in the `Log` file.
