# How to run ephys experiments - Reiser Lab - G4 setup

This documentation covers the specifications of the G4 arena and how to run, design and analyse different experiments.

# Repositories for running different experiments on the Reiser Lab Electrophysiology Setup
Code for running different experimental protocols can be found in different Github repositories. 
The code found in these repositories contain a mixture of code that works using the G4 software tools (see link above) that run within a GUI, and custom scripts that work through the command line in MATLAB.
