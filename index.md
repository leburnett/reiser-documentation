This documentation covers the setup specificiations and how to design, run and analyse experiments using different G3/G4 LED Panel setups within the Reiser Lab at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus.

## Repositories
Code for running different experimental protocols can be found in different Github repositories. 

Electrophysiology (Ephys) Setup:
- 1: [Direction selectivity probe protocol]
- 2: [Nested receptive field protocol]

Freely-walking Setup:
- 3: [Freely-walking optomotor]

Tethered Flight Setup:
- 4: [Two choice bar fixation protocol]
